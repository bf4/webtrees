msgid "Adding multimedia files (MM) to the GEDCOM is a very nice feature.  Although this program already has a great look without media, if you add pictures or other MM to your relatives, it will only get better.<br /><br /><b>What you should understand about MM.</b><br />There are many formats of MM. Although PhpGedView can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. PhpGedView is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  PhpGedView is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload Media form under your MyGedView menu.  You can also use the Upload option on the Multimedia form to upload media items."

Please see the topic <b>Calendar Conversion</b> below for a description of this code.<br /><b>@&nbsp;A&nbsp;O&nbsp;E</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;internal GEDCOM format</p><p style=\"padding-left: 50px\"><b>@</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;calendar code, e.g. @#DGREGORIAN@, @#DHEBREW@, etc.<br /><b>A</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;day, i.e. 01 to 31<br /><b>O</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;month, e.g. JAN, FEB, MAR, etc.<br /><b>E</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;year, e.g. 1776, 1867, 2007, etc.<br /><br />To see the unconverted dates, use <b>A&nbsp;O&nbsp;E</b> or <b>@&nbsp;A&nbsp;O&nbsp;E</b></p><b>Some examples</b>, using the date 08&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1965:<p style=\"padding-left: 25px\"><b>d&nbsp;M&nbsp;Y</b> = 08&nbsp;Sep&nbsp;1965<br /><b>D&nbsp;j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y</b> = W&nbsp;8&nbsp;September&nbsp;1965<br /><b>j&nbsp;M&nbsp;y</b> = 8&nbsp;Sep&nbsp;65<br /><b>l&nbsp;-&nbsp;d&nbsp;-&nbsp;F&nbsp;-&nbsp;Y</b> = Wednesday&nbsp;-&nbsp;08&nbsp;-&nbsp;September&nbsp;-&nbsp;1965<br /><b>y/m/d</b> = 1965/09/08</p><br /></li><li><b>Calendar Conversion</b><br />The <b>R</b> code is somewhat unusual in its behavior.  When this code appears in the date format, the normal date will be shown a second time, but in a different calendar system.  The elements of this alternate calendar date will obey the same rules as those of the main part of the format specification, except that the output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from the regular date.  The examples given under <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar will make this a little clearer.<br /><br />The alternate calendar to be used for the <b>R</b> code is determined according to the current page language.  When the page language is Hebrew, the <b>Jewish</b> calendar will be used.  When the page language is Arabic, the <b>Hijri</b> calendar will be used.  For all other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is used.<br /><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of calendar format that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page.  The difference between the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined at the Language Configuration level, works only on selected languages but across all GEDCOMs on the site.  The calendar option set at the GEDCOM Configuration level works on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which that option has been set.<br /><ul><li><b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calendar is also called <b>French Republican</b> calendar.<br /><br />Except for a very brief period in May 1871, this calendar system was only in use in France and only between 22&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1792 and 31&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1805.  Accordingly, the French Revolutionary calendar format will only be applicable when the date is within that range.<br /><br />Two example date formats, assuming the page language to be English, will illustrate the action of the <b>R</b> code:<br /><b>Y.m.d&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>1805.04.26&nbsp;(XIII.08.06)</b> or <b>1806.01.01</b>;&nbsp; <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;(22&nbsp;Vendemiaire&nbsp;VI)</b> or <b>1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1806</b>.</li></ul><br /></li><li><b>Language alternatives</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbreviated texts for the Advanced codes <b>D</b> and <b>M</b> are set in the file <i>languages/lang.xx.php</i>, using  statements like <code>$pgv_lang[\"sunday_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Su\";</code>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>$pgv_lang[\"apr_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"April\";</code><br /><br />These can be changed by using a <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> file as described in Wiki and ReadMe text for language adjustments, for example:<br /><code>$pgv_lang[\"sunday_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Sun\";<br />$pgv_lang[\"apr_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Apr\";</code><br /><br /><br /></li><li><b>Localization</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special formatting rules exist for a number of languages, particularly declension of month endings according to how the date is phrased.  These special rules are implemented in the various <i>includes/extras/functions.xx.php</i> files.</li></ul>"

It may help to have an understanding of HTML appropriate for a web site administrator. This program uses <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> as well. A different CSS is implemented for each theme.  You can use classes from these style sheets to control the appearance of your messages.<br /><br />If you need more help with this, the PhpGedView web site has some examples of how to use these tags in your GEDCOM News block.<br /><br />As with the FAQ list, GEDCOM News titles and News text allow embedded references to $pgv_lang, $factarray, and $GLOBALS variables to provide complete flexibility in the creation of News items that are sensitive to the currently active language.<br /><br />The following description, taken from the Help text for the FAQ list, is equally applicable to GEDCOM News items.<br /><br />HTML entities are a very easy way to add special characters to your FAQ titles and text.  You can use symbolic names, decimal numbers, or hexadecimal numbers.  A complete list of HTML entities, their coding, and their representation by your browser can be found here:  <a href=\"http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML entity lists</a><br /><br />On occasion, you may need to show a Tilde character&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x7E;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;or a Number Sign&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;in your URLs or text.  These characters have a special meaning to the PhpGedView Help system and can only be entered in their hexadecimal or decimal form.  Similarly, the&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&lt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&gt;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;characters that usually enclose HTML tags must be entered in their hexadecimal or decimal forms if they are to be treated as normal text instead of signalling an HTML tag.<ul><li><b>&amp;&#x23;35;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&amp;&#x23;x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x23;</b></li><li><b>&amp;&#x23;60;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&amp;&#x23;x3C;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x3C;</b></li><li><b>&amp;&#x23;62;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&amp;&#x23;x3E;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x3E;</b></li><li><b>&amp;&#x23;126;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&amp;&#x23;x7E;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&#x7E;</b></li></ul>There is a&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&amp;tilde;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML entity, but this symbol is not interpreted as a Tilde when coded in URLs.<br /><br />You can insert references to entries in the language files or to values of global variables.  Examples: <ul><li><b>&#x23;pgv_lang[add_to_cart]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the language variable $pgv_lang[\"add_to_cart\"], and if it were to appear in this field, would show as <b>Add to Clippings Cart</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language.</li><li><b>&#x23;factarray[AFN]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the Fact name $factarray[\"AFN\"], and if it were to appear in this field, would show as <b>Ancestral File Number (AFN)</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language. </li><li><b>&#x23;PGV_VERSION&#x23;&nbsp;&#x23;PGV_VERSION_RELEASE&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the constant PGV_VERSION, a space, and a reference to the constant PGV_VERSION_RELEASE, and if they were to appear in this field, would show as <b>#PGV_VERSION#&nbsp;#PGV_VERSION_RELEASE#</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language.</li><li><b>&#x23;GLOBALS[GEDCOM]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the global variable $GEDCOM, which is the name of the current GEDCOM file.

You should put your customized FAQ list titles and entries into the <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> files (<i>xx</i> is the code for each language), using the following format:<br />$pgv_lang[\"faq_title1\"] = \"This is a sample FAQ title\";<br />$pgv_lang[\"faq_body1\"] = \"This is a sample FAQ body.\";"

If, for example, you want to search for an event on December 14, you should type <b>14&nbsp;dec</b> because this is how the date is stored in the database.<br /><br />If you were to type <b>dec&nbsp;14</b>, the result could be a person connected to an event on 08&nbsp;<b>dec</b>ember&nbsp;18<b>14</b>.  Again, the results can be surprising.<br /><br />You can use regular expressions in your search if you are familiar with them.  For example, if you wanted to find all of the people who have dates in the 20th century, you could enter the search <b>19[0-9][0-9]</b> and you would get all of the people with dates from 1900-1999.<br /><br />If you need more help with this searching system, please let us know, so that we can extend this Help file as well.<br /><br />~Search the way you think the name is written (Soundex)~<br /><br />Soundex is a method of coding words according to their pronunciation.  This allows you to search the database for names and places when you don't know precisely how they are written.  PhpGedView supports two different Soundex algorithms that produce vastly different results.<ul><li><b>Basic</b><br />This method, patented in 1918 by Russell, is very simple and can be done by hand.<br /><br />Because the Basic method retains the first letter of the name as part of the resultant code, it is not very helpful when you are unsure of that first letter.  The Basic algorithm is not well suited to names that were originally in languages other than English, and even with English names the results are very surprising.  For example, a Basic Soundex search for <b>Smith</b> will return not only <b>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, Schmitt</b>, all of which are clearly variations of <b>Smith</b>, but also <b>Smead, Sneed, Smoote, Sammett, Shand,</b> and <b>Snoddy</b>.  <br /><br /></li><li><b>Daitch-Mokotoff</b><br />This method, developed in 1985, is much more complex than the Basic method and is not easily done by hand.<br /><br />A Soundex search using this method produces much more accurate results.</li></ul>For details on both Soundex algorithms, visit this <a href=\"http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/soundex.html\" target=_blank><b>Jewish Genealogical Society</b></a> web page.<br /><br /> ~Search and Replace~<br /><br />Here, you can search for a misspelling or other inaccurate information and replace it with correct information.<br /><br /><b>Searching</b><br />This feature performs searching just like a <a href=\"help_text.php?help=search_enter_terms_help\">normal search</a>.<br /><br /><b>Replacing</b><br />All instances of the search term that are found are replaced by the replacement term in the database.<br /><br /><b>For Example...</b><br />Suppose you accidentally misspell your great-grandpa Michael's name.
