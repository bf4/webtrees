$faqlist["FAQ_030_PLACES"]="<strong>PLACES</strong>: We try, wherever known, to include the full place descriptive: city and/or township (Twp) as well as the County, State, and we usually add USA (preferred - not US, U.S., or U.S.A.) behind the state.  For foreign countries, we use the use the GEDCOM-approved 3 letter standard abbreviation rather than the country name: England [ENG], Scotland [SCT], Ireland [IRE], France [FRA], Italy [ITA], etc. The format we prefer is: <i>Indianapolis, Center Twp, Marion Co, Indiana, USA</i>  States should not be abbreviated to the two letters; we generally do not use full stops (.) in names or locations, like <i>Shelbyville, Addison Twp, Shelby Co, Indiana, USA</i> instead of <i>Shelbyville, Addison Twp., Shelby Co., IN</i> or <i>Shelbyville, Addison Township, Shelby County, Indiana, U.S.A.</i>";
