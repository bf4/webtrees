$pgv_lang["add_facts_general_help"]="~General info about adding~<br />When you have added a fact, note, source, or multimedia file to a record in the database, the addition still has to be approved by a user who has Accept rights.<br /><br />Until the changes have been Accepted, they are identified as \"pending\" by a differently coloured border.  All users with Edit rights can see these changes as well as the original information.  Users who do not have Edit rights will only see the original information. When the addition has been Accepted, the borders will disappear and the new data will display normally, replacing the old.  At that time, users without Edit rights will see the new data too.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["add_gedcom_help"]="~#pgv_lang[add_gedcom]#~<br /><br />When you use the <b>#pgv_lang[add_gedcom]#</b> function, it is assumed that you have already uploaded the GEDCOM file to your server using a program or method <u>external</u> to PhpGedView, for example, <i>ftp</i> or <i>network connection</i>.  The file you wish to add could also have been left over from a previous <b>#pgv_lang[upload_gedcom]#</b> procedure.<br /><br />If the input GEDCOM file is not yet on your server, you <u>have to</u> get it there first, before you can start with Adding.<br /><br />Instead of uploading a GEDCOM file, you can also upload a ZIP file containing the GEDCOM file, either with PhpGedView, or using an external program. PhpGedView will recognise the ZIP file automatically and will extract the GEDCOM file and filename from the ZIP file.<br /><br />If a GEDCOM file with the same name already exists in PhpGedView, it will be overwritten. However, all GEDCOM settings made previously will be preserved.<br /><br />You are guided step by step through the procedure.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["add_media_help"]="~#pgv_lang[add_media]#~<br /><br />Adding multimedia files (MM) to the GEDCOM is a very nice feature.  Although this program already has a great look without media, if you add pictures or other MM to your relatives, it will only get better.<br /><br /><b>What you should understand about MM.</b><br />There are many formats of MM. Although PhpGedView can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. PhpGedView is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colours that you use.  The number of colours can differ from pure black and white (two colours) to true colours (millions of colours) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colours are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  PhpGedView is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload Media form under your #pgv_lang[mgv]# menu.  You can also use the Upload option on the Multimedia form to upload media items.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["alpha_help"]="~ALPHABETICAL INDEX~<br /><br />Clicking a letter in the Alphabetical index will display a list of the names that start with the letter you clicked.<br /><br />The second to last item in the Alphabetical index can be <b>#pgv_lang[NN]#</b>.  This entry will be present when there are people in the database whose surname has not been recorded or does not contain any recognizable letters.  Unknown surnames are often recorded as <b>?</b>, and these will be recognised as <b>#pgv_lang[NN]#</b>.  This will also happen if the person is unknown.<br /><br /><b>Note:</b><br />Surnames entered as, for example, <b>Nn</b>, <b>NN</b>, <b>Unknown</b>, or even <b>N.N.</b> will <u>not</u> be found in the <b>#pgv_lang[NN]#</b> list. Instead, you will find these persons by clicking <b>N</b> or <b>U</b> because these are the initial letters of those names.  PhpGedView cannot possibly account for all possible ways of entering unknown surnames;  there is no recognised convention for this.<br /><br />At the end of the Alphabetical index you see <b>ALL</b>. When you click on this item, you will see a list of all surnames in the database.<br /><br /><b>Missing letters?</b><br />If your Alphabetical index appears to be incomplete, with missing letters, your database doesn't contain any surnames that start with that missing letter.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["apply_privacy_help"]="~#pgv_lang[apply_privacy]#~<br /><br />When this option is checked, the output file will pass through privacy checks according to the selected option.

All facts, dates, events, etc. are stored here. GEDCOM files have to follow strict rules because they must be exchangeable between many programs, independent of platforms or operating systems.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["def_pgv_help"]="~PhpGedView~<br />PhpGedView (or PGV) does not just put static pages on the Web; it is dynamic and can be customised in many ways.<br /><br />PhpGedView was created by John Finlay to view GEDCOM files online.  John started developing the program on his own.  An international team of developers and translators has since joined him and is working to improve the program.  Among the more significant features that have been added or improved in the program are its extensive support of languages other than English, and the ability to add and edit events online.<br /><br />";

You will find the link to customise this page in the Welcome block or separately when the Welcome block is not present.<br /><br />You can choose from the following blocks:<ul><li><a href=\"#mygedview_welcome\"><b>Welcome</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_customize\"><b>Customise MyGedView</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_message\"><b>Messages</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_events\"><b>Upcoming events</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_onthisday\"><b>On this Day in Your History</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_charts\"><b>Charts</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_favorites\"><b>My Favourites</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_stats\"><b>GEDCOM Statistics</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_myjournal\"><b>My Journal</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_media\"><b>Random Media</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_loggedin\"><b>Logged In Users</b></a></li><li><a href=\"#mygedview_recent_changes\"><b>Recent Changes</b></a></li></ul><br />";

$pgv_lang["rss_feed_help"]="~RSS FEED SETTINGS~<br /><br />The ATOM/RSS feed available in PhpGedView allows anyone to view, using a suitable feed aggregator, the contents of your site's Welcome page without visiting the site. Most aggregators will pop up a notice letting the user know when something has changed on a page being monitored. This essentially allows anyone to monitor your PhpGedView site without needing to visit it regularly.<br /><br />The Feed block is used to customise the link to the feed, allowing specific feed types (most readers can deal with most types so this can usually be left at the default), and the specific module you would like in your feed. The language of the feed and the GEDCOM used will be based on the language and GEDCOM active in PhpGedView when you select the feed.<br /><br />The types of feed that can be generated include ATOM, RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0, RSS 0.92, HTML and JavaScript. The first four types are for feed aggregators, while JavaScript and HTML are meant to enable inclusion of the feeds in other web pages.  Note that the numbers of the RSS feed indicate different styles, not a different version.<br /><br />There is an option to select authentication that will log the user in, and allow the user to view, using a suitable RSS aggregator, any information that he could normally view if logged in. Basic Authentication uses <i>Basic HTTP Authentication</i> to log the user in. Future enhancements might allow <i>Digest Authentication</i>.<br /><br />This <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)' target='_blank' alt='Wikipedia article' title='Wikipedia article'><b>Wikipedia article</b></a> contains comprehensive information and links about RSS and the various RSS formats. <i>Basic HTTP Authentication</i> is discussed in this <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_authentication_scheme' target='_blank' alt='Wikipedia article' title='Wikipedia article'><b>Wikipedia article</b></a>, while <i>Digest Authentication</i> is discussed in this <a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication' target='_blank' alt='Wikipedia article' title='Wikipedia article'><b>Wikipedia article</b></a>.<br /><br />";

$pgv_lang["upload_gedcom_help"]="~#pgv_lang[upload_gedcom]#~<br /><br />Unlike the <b>#pgv_lang[add_gedcom]#</b> function, the GEDCOM file you wish to add to your database does not have to be on your server.<br /><br />In Step 1 you select a GEDCOM file from your local computer. Type the complete path and file name in the text box or use the <b>Browse</b> button on the page.<br /><br />You can also use this function to upload a ZIP file containing the GEDCOM file. PhpGedView will recognise the ZIP file and extract the file and the filename automatically.<br /><br />If a GEDCOM file with the same name already exists in PhpGedView, it will, after your confirmation, be overwritten. However, all GEDCOM settings made previously will be preserved.<br /><br />You will find more help on other pages of the procedure.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["upload_media_folder_help"]="~#pgv_lang[folder]#~<br /><br />Your GEDCOM configuration allows up to #GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS]# directory levels beyond the default <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#</b> where uploaded media files are normally stored. This lets you organise your media files, and you don't need to be as concerned about maintaining unique names for each media file.<br /><br />In this field you specify the destination directory on your server where the uploaded media file is to be stored.  Be sure to pay attention to the case (upper or lower case) of what you enter or select here, since file and directory names are case sensitive.<br /><br />If the directory name you enter here does not exist, it will be created automatically. If you enter more than the additional #GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS]# directory levels permitted by your GEDCOM configuration, your input will be truncated accordingly.<br /><br />Thumbnails will be uploaded or created in an identical directory structure, starting with <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#thumbs/</b>.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["upload_server_folder_help"]="~#pgv_lang[server_folder]#~<br /><br />The administrator has enabled up to #GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS]# folder levels below the default <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#</b>.  This helps to organise the media files and reduces the possibility of name collisions.<br /><br />In this field, you specify the destination folder where the uploaded media file should be stored.  The matching thumbnail file, either uploaded separately or generated automatically, will be stored in a similar folder structure starting at <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#thumbs/</b> instead of <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#</b>.  You do not need to enter the <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#</b> part of the destination folder name.<br /><br />If you are not sure about what to enter here, you should contact your site administrator for advice.<br /><br />";
$pgv_lang["view_server_folder_help"]="~#pgv_lang[server_folder]#~<br /><br />The administrator has enabled up to #GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY_LEVELS]# folder levels below the default <b>#GLOBALS[MEDIA_DIRECTORY]#</b>.  This helps to organise the media files and reduces the possibility of name collisions.<br /><br />In this field, you select the media folder whose contents you wish to view.  When you select <b>#pgv_lang[all]#</b>, all media files will be shown without regard to the folder in which they are stored.  This can produce a very long list of media items.<br /><br />";
