The LANG_CHANGELOG.txt file was getting too big to work with easily.

Use this file to follow the changes made to the English language files
between different versions of phpGedView.  There are eight separate CHANGELOG files,
one to correspond to each file that together make up the entire set of English text.

The CHANGELOG files are:
		CHANGELOG_admin.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_configure_help.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_countries.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_editor.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_facts.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_faqlist.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_help_text.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_lang.en.txt

	f - Minor format change
	F - Major format change
	p - Punctuation change  (doesn't affect translation)

The above list of codes may be amended as new situations arise.
For massive changes, the variable names should be listed in the order in which they
occur in the respective language files.
