  <h2>1. General usage<a name="general" id="general"></a></h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>1.1 - Why can't I login?<a name="faq1_1" id=
    "faq1_1"></a></dt>

    <dd>There are many possible reasons. The most common reason is
    that you have simply entered the wrong username or password.
    Please double-check that you have entered the correct
    information and try again. If it still doesn't work, you can
    request a new password by clicking the link <em>"Forgotten your
    password?"</em> on the login page.</dd>

    <dd>When you enter the correct username and password, you will
    be redirected to the page on which you clicked the
    <em>"Login"</em> link. If you find that after being redirected
    you are still not logged in, the problem is almost certainly
    related to cookies. PunBB relies on cookies to determine if you
    are logged in or not. Make sure that your browser it setup to
    accept cookies. If you are still unable to login, you should
    contact an administrator of the forums you are having problems
    with.</dd>

    <dt>1.2 - Does PunBB support BBCode and if so, how do I use it?
    <a name="faq1_2" id="faq1_2"></a></dt>

    <dd>Yes, PunBB supports BBCode. It supports a subset of the
    tags that are present in many other bulletin boards. The tags
    supported by PunBB are bold, underline, italic, color, url,
    email, img, quote and code. Usage instructions can be found in
    the script help.php. Links to this script can be found next to
    text areas that allow BBCode (e.g. when posting a
    message).</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>2. Administration<a name="admin" id="admin"></a></h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>2.1 - I keep seeing messages like <em>"Bad
    HTTP_REFERER."</em>. How can I get rid of them?<a name="faq2_1"
    id="faq2_1"></a></dt>

    <dd>When a script in PunBB receives form data, it checks the
    CGI variable HTTP_REFERER (misspelled in the HTTP standard) to
    make sure that the form was submitted from the correct script.
    The check is only made for administrators and moderators. The
    referrer check is a security mechanism that prevents malicious
    users from deceiving administrators and moderators by silently
    and invisibly submitting a form from an external page to one of
    the scripts in PunBB.</dd>

    <dd>The referrer check can fail for a number of reasons. The
    check relies on the variable <em>"Base URL"</em> from the
    options page in the admin interface. If <em>"Base URL"</em> is
    not correctly set, the referrer check will fail. It is also
    vital that you visit the forums by entering the exact URL found
    in <em>"Base URL"</em> into your browsers address bar. If
    <em>"Base URL"</em> is set to http://somehost.com and you visit
    the forums by going to http://www.somehost.com (note the www
    part), the check will fail.</dd>

    <dd>Another common reason for the check to fail is that you are
    browsing the forum through a proxy or firewall of some sort
    that is stripping HTTP_REFERER from all requests. Norton
    Internet Security and Norton Personal Firewall are known to
    strip HTTP_REFERER in its default setup. Some popup/ad stoppers
    are also known to do this (most of them don't though).</dd>

    <dd>Note: You can find information on how to setup Norton
    Internet Security and Norton Personal Firewall to not strip
    referrer information at the following addresses: <a
    href="http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/sunset-c2002kb.nsf/672c231f89ff479085256ee600556cc3/4ef3ba8adbc86ab285256ede00518df1">

    2003 and 2004</a>.</dd>

    <dt>2.2 - How do I grant a user moderator access to a certain
    forum? <a name="faq2_2" id="faq2_2"></a></dt>

    <dd>The first step is to move the user user to the moderators
    group. This can be done in the user's profile under
    <em>"Administration"</em>.</dd>

    <dd>The next step is to give the new moderator access rights to
    one or more forums. This is also done in the user's profile.
    Just below the drop-down menu we just used, you will find a
    list of forums together with a checkbox. Select the forums you
    want to grant the user moderator access to and click
    <em>"Update forums"</em>. The user is now a moderator and can
    edit and delete posts and topics in the forums you
    selected.</dd>

    <dt>2.3 - Avatar uploads don't work. What could be wrong?
    <a name="faq2_3" id="faq2_3"></a></dt>

    <dd>In order for avatar uploads to work, the user account under
    which the webserver runs must have write permissions to the
    avatar directory. In UNIX (or UNIX-like) operating systems,
    this is usually done via the command <em>"chmod"</em>. Most FTP
    clients have support for this and it is usually done by
    right-clicking the directory and selecting something along the
    lines of <em>"Attributes"</em> or <em>"Permissions"</em>. If
    you don't know what values to enter, try 0777 (or just 777 if
    you can only enter three digits).</dd>

    <dt>2.4 - I get a message saying "Unable to write configuration
    cache file to cache directory.". What's wrong?<a name="faq2_4"
    id="faq2_4"></a></dt>

    <dd>Similar to avatar upload, where PunBB needs to be able to
    write to the avatar directory, PunBB needs to be able to write
    to the cache directory. See the above question for
    details.</dd>

    <dt>2.5 - People using Internet Explorer 6 are unable to login.
    Why? <a name="faq2_5" id="faq2_5"></a></dt>

    <dd>The problem is related to how Internet Explorer 6 handles
    third party cookies. A first party cookie is a cookie that
    originates from the host domain, whereas a third party cookie
    originates from another domain. The problem arises when a
    website utilizes some form of domain redirect or frame-based
    redirect service. I.e. a service that redirects the user to the
    real location instead of pointing directly at it. The best
    solution to the problem is to not use such a domain redirect
    service and use a "real" domain instead. However, a quick fix
    that seems to work most of the time can be found in the script
    include/functions.php. Search for P3P and follow the
    instructions.</dd>

    <dt>2.6 - I've set the forum into maintenance mode and I'm
    logged out. How do I turn it off?<a name="faq2_6" id=
    "faq2_6"></a></dt>

    <dd>Copy/upload the script turn_off_maintenance_mode.php from
    the directory extras/ into the forum root directory and run it
    through your browser. A message will appear when the operation
    has completed. Don't forget to remove the script from the forum
    root directory when finished.</dd>

    <dt>2.7 - What's this <em>"DEBUG mode"</em> and how do I enable
    it? <a name="faq2_7" id="faq2_7"></a></dt>

    <dd><em>"DEBUG mode"</em> can be used to display more detailed
    error messages in case of failure. These error messages can be
    helpful when tracking down the cause of the failure. When
    <em>"DEBUG mode"</em> is enabled, PunBB will also display the
    script generation time and the number of SQL queries executed
    for every page. This information will be displayed in the page
    footer.</dd>

    <dd>To enable <em>"DEBUG mode"</em>, open up the file
    include/common.php in a text editor and locate the line that
    starts with <em>"//define('PUN_DEBUG', 1);".</em> It it located
    at the very top of the file below the software license
    preamble. Then remove the two slashes in the beginning of the
    line and save/upload the script. Once you've solved the
    problem, it is recommended that <em>"DEBUG mode"</em> be turned
    off again (just add the two slashes again).</dd>

    <dt>2.8 - Is it possible to have more than one <em>"Base
    URL"</em>? <a name="faq2_8" id="faq2_8"></a></dt>

    <dd>No, it's not. However, there is extremely seldom a need to
    have more than one. The need often arises when you access your
    forums through one URL externally and one URL internally. The
    internal URL is often the IP address or the name of the
    computer that runs the webserver. The problem is easily solved
    by editing your hosts file. The hosts file contains a list of
    IP addresses and host names. If you haven't made any changes to
    it earlier, it unsually only contains the IP address 127.0.0.1
    and the hostname localhost. If you enter http://localhost/ into
    your browsers adress field, your operating system will first
    check the hosts file to see if localhost can be found in there.
    If it finds it, it will navigate to the IP address 127.0.0.1
    instead of trying to look up the host name localhost with
    traditional DNS. So, what you want to do is to add a line to
    this file with the IP address of the webserver and the hostname
    that you use to access your server externally. If the host name
    for your forums is www.mycoolforums.com and the IP address of
    the webserver is 192.168.100.15, you would add the line:</dd>
    
    <dd>
      <pre>192.168.100.15      www.mycoolforums.com</pre>
    </dd>

    <dd>The hosts file is located in different locations depending
    on what operating system you run. Here's a list of where the
    file can usually be found in a few operating systems:</dd>

    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows 95/98/ME: c:\windows\hosts</li>

        <li>Windows NT/2000/XP:
        c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts</li>

        <li>Linux/UNIX: /etc/hosts</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dd>Once you've added the line to your hosts file, you can set
    your <em>"Base URL"</em> to www.mycoolforums.com and use that
    URL to access your forums externally as well as
    internally.</dd>

    <dt>2.9 - I've updated the database manually, but the changes
    have no effect. What's up? <a name="faq2_9" id=
    "faq2_9"></a></dt>

    <dd>In order to decrease the load on the database server, PunBB
    caches parts of the database to PHP scripts in the cache/
    directory. If you've made manual changes to any of the tables
    bans, config, categories, forums or ranks, the cached data
    might have to be updated. To do this, simply delete all PHP
    scripts in the cache/ directory. PunBB will regenerate them
    when it needs them.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>3. Modifications and site integration<a name="mods" id=
  "mods"></a></h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>3.1 - How do I add more smilies to my forums?<a name=
    "faq3_1" id="faq3_1"></a></dt>

    <dd>Adding more smilies to your forums is not difficult, but it
    involves editing one of the scripts that comes with PunBB.
    Here's a step-by-step instruction. Having very basic knowledge
    of PHP or programming in general is recommended.</dd>

    <dd>
      <ol>
        <li>Copy the smilies you want to add/change to into the
        directory img/smilies/.</li>

        <li>Open up the file include/parser.php in a text editor
        and locate the line that starts with <em>"// Here you can
        add additional smilies if you like"</em> (it's almost at
        the top of the file). There you will find two PHP arrays -
        $smiley_text and $smiley_img. $smiley_text contains the
        character combinations for the smileys (e.g. :D or
        :rolleyes:) and $smiley_img contains the filenames of the
        smiley images (e.g. big_smile.png or roll.png).</li>

        <li>For every new smiley that you want to add, add a
        character combination to $smiley_text and a filename to
        $smiley_img. Please note that you must escape the character
        ' (singlequote) with a backslash if you use it in any of
        your smilies (e.g. ':rock\'n\'roll:'). Singlequote must be
        escaped so that PHP can understand that it is not the end
        of the string, but a character in the string. The same goes
        for backslash. If your smiley contains a backslash, just
        must escape that backslash with another backslash (e.g.
        ':\\').</li>

        <li>Once you've added your smileys above, you should pay
        attention to the row below the smiley arrays. It says that
        if any of your smilies contain any of the characters &amp;,
        ", ', &lt; or &gt;, you must uncomment the row
        thereafter.</li>

        <li>Finally save/upload the file and try it out. A list of
        all installed smilies can be found at the bottom of the
        help text in help.php.</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>

    <dd>If you get a PHP error message stating that it encountered
    a <em>"Parse error"</em>, you probably forgot to escape a
    singlequote or backslash character in the $smiley_text
    array.</dd>

    <dt>3.2 - How can I use smilies of different sizes than 15x15
    pixels?<a name="faq3_2" id="faq3_2"></a></dt>

    <dd>To use non-15x15 pixel smilies, you must prevent PunBB from
    adding the width="15" and height="15" attributes to img tags.
    This can be done by editing include/parser.php in a text
    editor. Open up the file and search for:</dd>

    <dd>
      <pre>width="15" height="15"</pre>
    </dd>

    <dd>The text should be somewhere around line 260. Then replace
    the values with a width and height of your choice. If you want
    to use smilies of varying sizes, remove the attributes
    completely.</dd>

    <dt>3.3 - How do I add my own footer/header so that I can
    integrate my forums into design of the rest of my
    website?<a name="faq3_3" id="faq3_3"></a></dt>

    <dd>For this purpose, PunBB has a simple template system. The
    template files are located in include/template/. There are five
    templates - main.tpl, admin.tpl, help.tpl, maintenance.tpl and
    redirect.tpl. The file main.tpl contains the template for
    almost all pages that are displayed in the forum, admin.tpl is
    the template for the admin interface, help.php is for the help
    screen, maintenance.tpl is the template for the message page
    that is displayed when the forum is put in maintenance mode,
    and finally the file redirect.tpl is used to display the
    redirect pages e.g. when logging in or when posting a
    message.</dd>

    <dd>The templates contain variables that are replaced with
    actual content when a page is displayed. All variables in PunBB
    are enclosed in less-than and more-than signs (&lt; and &gt;).
    For example, the variable for the title of the forums is called
    &lt;pun_title&gt;. When PunBB displays the index page, it reads
    the file main.tpl and replaces &lt;pun_title&gt; with the title
    of the forums. There are 11 replacement variables in
    main.tpl.</dd>

    <dd>If you want to customize the look of PunBB so that it fits
    the design of other pages on your website, it is primarily the
    template files you should edit. For example, if you wanted to
    add your own logo at the top of all forum pages, you would edit
    main.tpl and add markup for displaying your logo at the
    appropriate position in the file. It is possible to include PHP
    scripts from the templates. See the next FAQ entry for more
    info on that.</dd>

    <dt>3.4 - Is it possible to include my own PHP scripts in the
    templates?<a name="faq3_4" id="faq3_4"></a></dt>

    <dd>Yes. PunBB has a special replacement variable called
    pun_include for including scripts in the templates. For
    example, if you wanted to include a script called banner.php
    at the bottom of all forum pages, you would place the script
    in include/user/ and add the following to your template
    files:</dd>

    <dd>
      <pre>&lt;pun_include "banner.php"&gt;</pre>
    </dd>

    <dd>The script banner.php must be located in the user include
    directory mentioned above. PunBB will execute the script and
    the pun_include variable will be replaced by any output that
    the script produces. Please note that all included scripts have
    access to the PunBB variables, so if you e.g. wanted to access
    the database, you could use the $db object just like the rest of
    PunBB does. Replacement of the pun_include variable is the last
    thing that PunBB does when it outputs a page, so you don't have
    to worry about not using variable names that PunBB uses.</dd>

    <dt>3.5 - I want to display information from the forums on my
    website's front page. How can I do this?<a name="faq3_5" id=
    "faq3_5"></a></dt>

    <dd>The script extern.php found in the forum root directory can
    output various bits of information from the forums. See
    <a href="dev.html#syndication">Developer Information</a> for
    more information.</dd>

    <dt>3.6 - Does PunBB provide RSS feeds for recent discussions?
    <a name="faq3_6" id="faq3_6"></a></dt>

    <dd>Yes. The script extern.php found in the forum root
    directory can produce RSS 0.91 feeds on recent discussions. See
    <a href="dev.html#syndication">Developer Information</a> for
    more information.</dd>

    <dt>3.7 - I've developed a modification for PunBB and I want to
    release it to the public. What do I do now?<a name="faq3_7" id=
    "faq3_7"></a></dt>

    <dd>Visit the PunBB.org <a href=
    "http://www.punbb.org/downloads.php">downloads page</a> and
    download the Mod SDK. It contains a text file with instructions,
    a template for the readme file (all mods have a readme.txt) and
    a template for a mod installation script (if needed).</dd>
