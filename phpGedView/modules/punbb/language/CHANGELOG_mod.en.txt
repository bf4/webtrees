GALLERY2 MODULE LANGUAGE FILE CHANGELOG

# $Id: $

Use this file to follow the changes made to the English language files
between different versions of phpGedView.  There are five separate CHANGELOG files,
one to correspond to each file that together make up the entire set of English text.

+ $pgv_lang["text"] / means added
- $pgv_lang["text"] / deleted
* $pgv_lang["text"] / text was changed

Additional codes, to help Translators, follow the date as follows:
	A - Added or moved from another file
	C - Capitalization  (doesn't affect translation)
	D - Deleted
	f - Minor format change
	F - Major format change
	p - Punctuation change  (doesn't affect translation)
	M - Moved to another file
	S - Spelling change		(doesn't affect translation)
	w - Minor wording change
	W - Major wording change or completely new text

The above list of codes may be amended as new situations arise.
For massive changes, the variable names should be listed in the order in which they
occur in the respective language files.
