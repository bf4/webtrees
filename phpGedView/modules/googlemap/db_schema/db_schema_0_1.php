 * Update the GM module database schema from version 0 to version 1
 *
 * Version 0: empty database
 * Version 1: create the tables, as per PGV 4.2.1
 *
 * The script should assume that it can be interrupted at
 * any point, and be able to continue by re-running the script.
 * Fatal errors, however, should be allowed to throw exceptions,
 * which will be caught by the framework.
 * It shouldn't do anything that might take more than a few
 * seconds, for systems with low timeout values.
