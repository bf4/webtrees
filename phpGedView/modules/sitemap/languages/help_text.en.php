You should copy these files to the server directory where PhpGedView is installed, and then log into the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/\" target=\"_blank\">Google webmaster tools</a> site to make Google aware of their presence.<br /><br />For more information on Google and Sitemap files, visit the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google webmaster tools</a> site.";
