In that case, they should come before the city.  The next part, \"Salt Lake,\" is the county.  \"Utah\" is the state, and \"USA\" is the country.  It is important to note each place because genealogical records are kept by the governments of each level.<br /><br />If a level of the place is unknown, you should leave a space between the commas.

msgid "Adding multimedia files (MM) to the GEDCOM is a very nice feature.  Although this program already has a great look without media, if you add pictures or other MM to your relatives, it will only get better.<br /><br /><b>What you should understand about MM.</b><br />There are many formats of MM. Although PhpGedView can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file's size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. PhpGedView is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture's size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in \"dpi\" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server's connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  PhpGedView is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.  If it has been enabled by your site administrator, you can use the Upload Media form under your MyGedView menu.  You can also use the Upload option on the Multimedia form to upload media items."

The elements of this alternate calendar date will obey the same rules as those of the main part of the format specification, except that the output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from the regular date.

For all other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is used.<br /><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of calendar format that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page.  The difference between the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined at the Language Configuration level, works only on selected languages but across all GEDCOMs on the site.  The calendar option set at the GEDCOM Configuration level works on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which that option has been set.<br /><ul><li><b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calendar is also called <b>French Republican</b> calendar.<br /><br />Except for a very brief period in May 1871, this calendar system was only in use in France and only between 22&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1792 and 31&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1805.  Accordingly, the French Revolutionary calendar format will only be applicable when the date is within that range.<br /><br />Two example date formats, assuming the page language to be English, will illustrate the action of the <b>R</b> code:<br /><b>Y.m.d&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>1805.04.26&nbsp;(XIII.08.06)</b> or <b>1806.01.01</b>;&nbsp; <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;(22&nbsp;Vendemiaire&nbsp;VI)</b> or <b>1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1806</b>.</li></ul><br /></li><li><b>Language alternatives</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbreviated texts for the Advanced codes <b>D</b> and <b>M</b> are set in the file <i>languages/lang.xx.php</i>, using  statements like <code>i18n::translate("

The <b>BET</b> form indicates a single occurrence of the event, sometime between the stated dates and is used with events such as birth.<br /><br />Imprecise dates, where the day of the month or the month is missing, are always interpreted as the first or last possible date, depending on whether that imprecise date occurs before or after the separating keyword.  For example, <b>FEB&nbsp;1804</b> is interpreted as <b>01&nbsp;FEB&nbsp;1804</b> when it occurs before the TO or AND, and as <b>29&nbsp;FEB&nbsp;1804</b> when it occurs after the TO or AND.</li></ol><b>Be sure to enter dates and abbreviations in <u>English</u>,</b> because then the GEDCOM file is exchangeable and PhpGedView can translate all dates and abbreviations properly into the currently active language.  Furthermore, PhpGedView does calculations using these dates.

PhpGedView supports two different Soundex algorithms that produce vastly different results.<ul><li><b>Basic</b><br />This method, patented in 1918 by Russell, is very simple and can be done by hand.<br /><br />Because the Basic method retains the first letter of the name as part of the resultant code, it is not very helpful when you are unsure of that first letter.  The Basic algorithm is not well suited to names that were originally in languages other than English, and even with English names the results are very surprising.  For example, a Basic Soundex search for <b>Smith</b> will return not only <b>Smith, Smid, Smit, Schmidt, Smyth, Smithe, Smithee, Schmitt</b>, all of which are clearly variations of <b>Smith</b>, but also <b>Smead, Sneed, Smoote, Sammett, Shand,</b> and <b>Snoddy</b>.  <br /><br /></li><li><b>Daitch-Mokotoff</b><br />This method, developed in 1985, is much more complex than the Basic method and is not easily done by hand.<br /><br />A Soundex search using this method produces much more accurate results.</li></ul>For details on both Soundex algorithms, visit this <a href=\"http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/soundex.html\" target=_blank><b>Jewish Genealogical Society</b></a> web page.<br /><br /> ~Search and Replace~<br /><br />Here, you can search for a misspelling or other inaccurate information and replace it with correct information.<br /><br /><b>Searching</b><br />This feature performs searching just like a <a href=\"help_text.php?help=search_enter_terms_help\">normal search</a>.<br /><br /><b>Replacing</b><br />All instances of the search term that are found are replaced by the replacement term in the database.<br /><br /><b>For Example...</b><br />Suppose you accidentally misspell your great-grandpa Michael's name.
