Although <b>webtrees</b> can handle most of them, there some things to consider.<br /><ul><li><b>Formats</b><br />Pictures can be edited and saved in many formats.  For example, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, etc.  If the same original picture was used to create each of the formats, the viewed image will appear to be the same size no matter which format is used.  However, the image files stored in the database will vary considerably in size.  Generally, .jpg images are considered to the most efficient in terms of storage space.</li><li><b>Image size</b><br />The larger the original image, the larger will be the resultant file\'s size. The picture should fit on the screen without scrolling; the maximum width or height should not be more than the width or height of the screen. <b>webtrees</b> is designed for screens of 1024x768 pixels but not all of this space is available for viewing pictures; the picture\'s size should be set accordingly.  To reduce file sizes, smaller pictures are more desirable.</li><li><b>Resolution</b><br />The resolution of a picture is usually measured in "dpi" (dots/inch), but this is valid only for printed pictures.  When considering pictures shown on screen, the only correct way is to use total dots or pixels. When printed, the picture could have a resolution of 150 - 300 dpi or more depending on the printer. Screen resolutions are rarely better than 50 pixels per inch.  If your picture will never be printed, you can safely lower its resolution (and consequently its file size) without affecting picture quality.  If a low-resolution picture is printed with too great a magnification, its quality will suffer; it will have a grainy appearance.</li><li><b>Color depth</b><br />Another way to keep a file small is to decrease the number of colors that you use.  The number of colors can differ from pure black and white (two colors) to true colors (millions of colors) and anything in between.  You can see that the more colors are used, the bigger the size of the files.</li></ul><b>Why is it important to keep the file size small?</b><br /><ul><li>First of all: Our webspace is limited.  The more large files there are, the more web space we need on the server. The more space we need, the higher our costs.</li><li>Bandwidth.  The more data our server has to send to the remote location (your location), the more we have to pay.  This is because the carrying capacity of the server\'s connection to the Internet is limited, and the link has to be shared (and paid for) by all of the applications running on the server.  <b>webtrees</b> is one of many applications that share the server.  The cost is normally apportioned according to the amount of data each application sends and receives.</li><li>Download time. If you have large files, the user (also you) will have to wait long for the page to download from the server.  Not everybody is blessed with a cable connection, broadband or DSL.</li></ul><b>How to upload your MM</b><br />There are two ways to upload media to the site.  If you have a lot of media items to upload you should contact the site administrator to discuss the best ways.

The elements of this alternate calendar date will obey the same rules as those of the main part of the format specification, except that the output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from the regular date.  The examples given under <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar will make this a little clearer.<br /><br />The alternate calendar to be used for the <b>R</b> code is determined according to the current page language.  When the page language is Hebrew, the <b>Jewish</b> calendar will be used.  When the page language is Arabic, the <b>Hijri</b> calendar will be used.  For all other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is used.<br /><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of calendar format that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page.  The difference between the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined at the Language Configuration level, works only on selected languages but across all GEDCOMs on the site.  The calendar option set at the GEDCOM Configuration level works on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which that option has been set.<br /><ul><li><b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calendar is also called <b>French Republican</b> calendar.<br /><br />Except for a very brief period in May 1871, this calendar system was only in use in France and only between 22&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1792 and 31&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1805.  Accordingly, the French Revolutionary calendar format will only be applicable when the date is within that range.<br /><br />Two example date formats, assuming the page language to be English, will illustrate the action of the <b>R</b> code:<br /><b>Y.m.d&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>1805.04.26&nbsp;(XIII.08.06)</b> or <b>1806.01.01</b>;&nbsp; <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;(22&nbsp;Vendemiaire&nbsp;VI)</b> or <b>1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1806</b>.</li></ul><br /></li><li><b>Language alternatives</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbreviated texts for the Advanced codes <b>D</b> and <b>M</b> are set in the file <i>languages/lang.xx.php</i>, using  statements like <code>Su&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Su";</code>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>April"&nbsp;=&nbsp;"April";</code><br /><br />These can be changed by using a <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> file as described in Wiki and ReadMe text for language adjustments, for example:<br /><code>Su&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Sun";<br />April&nbsp;=&nbsp;"Apr";</code><br /><br /><br /></li><li><b>Localization</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special formatting rules exist for a number of languages, particularly declension of month endings according to how the date is phrased.
