The Gallery 2 module allows PGV to interface with Gallery 2.

This module has been tested with Gallery 2 version 2.1.1
Gallery 2 is still in beta status and could change in the
future.  I will try to update the module if future changes
break compatably.

To install this module, download Gallery 2 from the official
website (see below) and install it in the modules/gallery2
directory.  Browse to the modules/gallery2 directory and
follow the instalation procedure.  Once installed, put the
gallery2.php file in the modules/ directory and replace
modules/gallery2/index.php with the one provided.   Go back
to your PGV page and browse to module.php?mod=gallery2 .  This
should bring you to the Gallery 2 module.

If you would like a random media block, copy
blocks/gallery2_random_media.php to your blocks directory.
