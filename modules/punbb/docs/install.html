  <h1>Installation and Upgrade Instructions</h1>

  <p>Instructions for the installation of PunBB 1.2.17 and for
  upgrading from previous versions.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A webserver (preferably <a href=
    "http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>).</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> 4.1.0 or later (PHP 5
    included).</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> 3.23.17 or later,
    <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> 7.0 or
    later or <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>. (see
    details below).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>MySQL: PunBB will not work at all with any version prior to
  3.23.17.</p>

  <p>PostgreSQL: PunBB 1.2.* has been thoroughly tested on various
  versions between 7.3.3 and 7.4.5, but it should work fine with
  any version greater than 7.0. Please note that PHP 4.3.0 or later
  is required for PostgreSQL support.</p>

  <p>SQLite: PunBB 1.2.* has only been thoroughly tested on
  versions 2.8.11 and 2.8.14 of SQLite, but should work with
  basically any version.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Copy/upload all contents of the directory upload/ into the
    directory where you want to run your forums.</li>

    <li>Run install.php from the forum root directory (e.g. open
    http://mydomain/myforums/install.php in your browser).
    Follow the instructions.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please report any problems you might encounter during
  installation in the <a href="http://forums.punbb.org/">PunBB.org
  Support Forums</a>.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading from 1.0</h2>

  <p>In order to upgrade from PunBB 1.0.* to 1.2.17, you must first
  update your current installation to 1.1. Download PunBB 1.1 from
  the PunBB.org downloads page and follow the upgrade instructions
  in the included install.html.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading from 1.1</h2>

  <p>In order to upgrade from PunBB 1.1.* to 1.2.17, you must first
  update your current installation to 1.2. Download PunBB 1.2 from
  the PunBB.org downloads page and follow the upgrade instructions
  in the included install.html.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading from 1.2.*</h2>

  <p>Follow these instructions to update your current 1.2.*
  installation to 1.2.17.</p>

  <p><strong style="color: #A00000">NOTE:</strong> Make a backup of
  your current forum directory before proceeding. Also, don't
  forget to make a backup of your forum database. Use the tool
  mysqldump for MySQL and pg_dump if you are using PostgreSQL. If
  you're using SQLite, just make a backup copy of the SQLite
  database file. You can also make database backups via most
  administration tools such as <a
  href="http://www.mysql.com/products/administrator/">MySQL
  Administrator</a>, <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">
  phpMyAdmin</a> and <a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/">
  phpPgAdmin</a>.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Copy/upload all contents of the directory upload/ into your
    old 1.2 directory (overwriting any existing files).</li>

    <li>Copy/upload the script 12_to_1217_update.php from the
    directory extras/ to the forum root directory and run it
    through your browser. Follow the instructions. Once the update
    script has finished you should remove the script from the forum
    root directory.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You should now be running PunBB 1.2.17.</p>

  <h2>Maximizing Performance</h2>

  <p>Here are some recommendations for maximizing the performance
  of PunBB.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Run it in a UNIX-like operating system!</li>

    <li>Use a proper webserver such as Apache or Zeus.</li>

    <li>Use a PHP cache/accelerator tool such as <a href=
    "http://eaccelerator.net/HomeUk">eAccelerator</a> or
    <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/APC">Alternative PHP
    Cache</a>.</li>

    <li>Make sure that PHP has zlib support so you can enable gzip
    output compression in Admin/Options. This greatly reduces the
    size of the XHTML output at the cost of a little CPU time. An
    alternative is to use the Apache modules mod_gzip or
    mod_deflate. The two methods yield similar results.</li>

    <li>Visit the administration interface and disable any forum
    features that are not used or you feel are unnecessary.</li>
  </ul>
