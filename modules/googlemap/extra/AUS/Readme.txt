In the ZIP-file in this directory you find files containing the geographic
location of all places in AUSTRALIA. These files are generated using the files
from the U.S. Geological Survey. The files can be downloaded from:
http://geonames.usgs.gov/bgn.html.

The ZIP-file in this directory contains CSV files for all states in Australia. 
These files can be imported into the place locations table of PGV.

If you upload the states.aus file, it will create just the place locations for each State and Territory without including all the individual places within each State.

If you don't need all the place names for all the states of Australia, just upload the file for the State of interest.

These files were a joint project, conceived by Nigel Osborne, with Paul Blair and Robert Sterry on production.

Although these files have been thoroughly tested, we cannot guarantee there won't be a few errors in the coordinates of some of these place names. Please direct any corrections needed to pblair30@optusnet.com.au or rsterry@zip.com.au

Good luck.

Robert Sterry
