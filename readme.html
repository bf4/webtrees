<b>webtrees</b> is based on the popular PhpGedView on line genealogy application ("PGV"). Whereas PGV aimed to do everything for everyone,<b>webtrees</b> aims to be more efficient and effective by using the right combination of third-party tools, design techniques and open standards.<b>webtrees</b> allows you to view and edit your genealogy on your website. It has full editing capabilities, full privacy functions, and supports multimedia like photos and document images. As an on line program, it fosters extended family participation and good ancestral recording habits, as it simplifies the process of collaborating with others working on your family lines. Your latest information is always on your web site and available for others to see, defined by viewing rules you set. For more information and to see working demos, visit http://webtrees.net/ 
<br /><br />
<b>webtrees</b> is Open Source software that has been produced by people from many countries freely donating their time and talents to the project. All service, support, and future development is dependent on the time developers are willing to donate to the project, often at the expense of work, recreation, and family. Beyond the few donations received from users, developers receive no compensation for the time they spend working on the project. There is also no outside source of revenue to support the project. Please consider these circumstances when making support requests and consider volunteering your own time and skills to make the project even stronger and better.

<div style="float:left;"><a name="system"><h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
The following instructions will guide you through a basic installation of <b>webtrees</b>. Initially, we recommend this approach, and that on completion of your new <b>webtrees</b> installation, you confirm your site is working correctly before considering the many advanced configuration options available.
<br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>A webserver. Apache and IIS are the most common types. There are no requirements to use a specific type or version.</li>
	<li>Approximately 65MB of disk space for the application files, plus whatever is needed for your multi-media files, gedcom files and database.</li>
	<li>PHP 5.2.3 or later. Note that many web hosts offer *both* PHP4 and PHP5, typically with PHP4 as the default. If this is the case, you can usually switch between the two using a control panel or a configuration file. Refer to your web host&#39;s support documentation for details.</li>
	 <ul>
		<li>The PHP/PDO library for MySQL. This is a server configuration option. It is enabled by default on most hosts. See http://php.net/pdo</li>
		<li>PHP should be configured to allow sufficient server resources (memory and execution time) for the size of your system. Typical requirements are:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Small systems (500 individuals): 16-32MB, 10-20 seconds</li>
				<li>Medium systems (5000 individuals): 32-64MB, 20-40 seconds</li>
				<li>Large systems (50000 individuals): 64-128MB, 40-80 seconds</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>MySQL 5.0.13 or later. <b>webtrees</b> can share a single database with other applications, by choosing a unique table prefix during configuration. 
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<div style="float:left;"><a name="install"><h3>INSTALLATION</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
The following instructions will guide you through a basic installation of <b>webtrees</b> . We recommend this approach initially, and that on completion you check your site is working correctly before looking at the more advanced configuration options available.
<br /><br />
<ol>
	<li>Download the latest version of <b>webtrees</b> available from http://launchpad.net/webtrees</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your web server.</li>
	<li>Open your web browser and enter the URL for your <b>webtrees</b> site (for example, http://www.yourserver.com/webtrees).</li>
	<li><b>webtrees</b> setup will start automatically. Follow the steps described there, reading all notes, and any red warning messages you receive carefully as you proceed through each step.</li>
	<li>On successful completion of all steps you will be taken to the GEDCOM (family tree) administration page where you can:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>UPLOAD a GEDCOM file from your local machine, or</li>
		<li>IMPORT a GEDCOM file from your server, if you have previously uploaded it to the webtrees/data folder, or</li>
		<li>CREATE a new, empty GEDCOM file.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
Once all these steps are completed you can check that everything is in place, then consider looking at more advanced configuration options.	
<hr width="100%">
<div style="float:left;"><a name="upgrade"><h3>UPGRADING</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: The following instructions do NOT apply to beta versions of <b>webtrees</b>. If you are testing beta versions they will have specific, usually more complex upgrade instructions, often requiring a completely fresh installation. Please read the latest Release Notes for any beta version.</b>
<br /><br />
<b>webtrees</b> has been designed to make upgrading to a new version of the software as straightforward as possible. Just follow these simple steps:
<ol>
	<li>Ensure you first have a good backup of your entire system, including all files and the database.</li>
	<li>Download the latest version of <b>webtrees</b> available from http://launchpad.net/webtrees</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your web server, copying all the new files directly over the existing ones.</li>
	<li>If any other requirements exist for the specific upgrade you are doing, you will be advised on screen as soon as you go to your site URL. This may occasionally include a requirement to re-import your GEDCOM (family tree) file.</li>
</ol>
<hr width="100%">
<div style="float:left;"><a name="gedcom"><h3>GEDCOM (family tree) FILES</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
When you IMPORT or UPLOAD a GEDCOM (family tree) file in <b>webtrees</b> the data from the file is all transferred to the database tables. The file itself is no longer used or required by <b>webtrees</b>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>If you use IMPORT, your file remains in the webtrees/data folder you first copied it to, and will not be changed by any subsequent editing of the <b>webtrees</b> data.</li>
	<li>If you use UPLOAD, the file is left in its original location, and again remains untouched.</li>
</ul>
<br />
When or if you change your genealogy data outside of <b>webtrees</b>, it is not necessary to delete your GEDCOM file or database from <b>webtrees</b> and start over.  Follow these steps to update a GEDCOM that has already been imported:
<ol>
	<li>Decide if you want to IMPORT or UPLOAD your new GEDCOM file.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Use UPLOAD if your GEDCOM file is smaller than your server's PHP file upload limit (often 2MB).The new file can have any name you choose.</li>
			<li>Use IMPORT for larger files. In this case you need to use FTP to first copy your file to the webtrees/data folder. Either copy over the existing file, or use a different name.</li>
		</ul>
	<li> Go to your <b>webtrees</b> GEDCOM configuration page. On the line relating to this GEDCOM file click either IMPORT or UPLOAD.</li>
	<li>Take careful note of the media items option (<i>"If you have created media objects in webtrees, and have edited your gedcom off-line using a program that deletes media objects, then tick this box to merge the current media objects with the new GEDCOM."</i>) In most cases you should leave this box <b>UNCHECKED</b>.</li>
	<li>Click "SAVE". <b>webtrees</b> will validate the GEDCOM again before importing.</li>
	<li>You can use a ZIP file to upload the GEDCOM, but only if you use the UPLOAD option. The file name can be anything you choose.</li>
</ol>
<hr width="100%">
<div style="float:left;"><a name="security"><h3>SECURITY</h3></a></div><div class="back"><a href="#top">back to top</a></div><div style="clear:both;"></div>
Even though <b>webtrees</b> gives you the ability to hide the details of living individuals, whenever you post personal details of living individuals on the Internet, you should first obtain the permission of EACH living person you plan to include.  There are many people who would not even want their name linked with their family history made public on the Internet and their wishes should be respected and honored.  Most family history programs allow you to choose the people who are exported when you create your GEDCOM file.  The most secure option is to deselect all living people in your genealogy program when you export your genealogical data to a GEDCOM file.
<br /><br />
If you wish to protect your GEDCOM (family tree) and other key files from being downloaded over the Internet you should do one or both of the following:
<ul>
	<li>Delete your GEDCOM (family tree) file from your web server after you have completed <b>webtrees</b> IMPORT process (<b>webtrees</b> does not need or use the file after it has been imported), or</li>
	<li>Place the webtrees/data folder outside the root directory of your web server or virtual host</li>
</ul>
Following is an example of moving the file outside the root directory:
<br /><br />
If your home directory is something like <b>/home/username</b>,<br />
and the root directory for your web site is <b>/home/username/public_html</b>,<br />
and you have installed webtrees in the <b>public_html/webtrees</b> directory,<br />
then you would create a new <b>data</b> folder in your home directory at the same level as your public_html directory, such as <b>/home/username/private/data</b>, and place your GEDCOM (family tree) file there.
<br /><br />
Then change the <b>Data file directory</b> setting on the Admin --> Site Administration page from the default <b>data/</b> to the new location <b>/home/username/private/data</b>
<br />
You will have <b>two</b> data directories:
<ul>
	<li>[path to webtrees]/data - just needs to contain config.ini.php</li>
	<li>/home/username/private/data - contains everything else.</li>
</ul>
Since your GEDCOM and other files now reside in a directory outside of your web server's root directory, your web server will not be able to fulfill requests to download them.  However, <b>webtrees</b> will still be able to read and use their contents.
<br /><br />
If you also want to protect the security of some or all of the media files you upload to webtrees, then you should enable the <b>Media Firewall</b> option (GEDCOM Configuration - Multimedia - Use Media Firewall). Setting the <b>Media Firewall Root Directory</b> to </b>data/</b> will move your media items to the protected folder created in /home/username/private/data. 
<br /><br />In the end it is YOUR responsibility to guarantee that there has been no violation of an individual's privacy and YOU could be held liable should private information be made public on the web sites that you administer.
<br /><br />
