 * Update the database schema from version 0 to version 1

 * Version 0: empty database
 * Version 1: create the pgv_site_setting table

 * Fatal errors, however, should be allowed to throw exceptions,
 * which will be caught by the framework.
 * It shouldn't do anything that might take more than a few
 * seconds, for systems with low timeout values.
