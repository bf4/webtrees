/**
  * Update the database schema from version 10 to version 11
 *
 * Version 0: empty database
 * Version 1: create the pgv_site_setting table
 * Version 2: create the user tables, as per PhpGedView 4.2.1
 * Version 3: create the genealogy tables, as per PhpGedView 4.2.1
 *   From Version 4 onwards, we make incremental changes, rather than
 *   trying to introspect/update.  It's more efficient, flexible,
 *   and allows us to update column types, indexes, etc.
 * Version 4: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_dates
 * Version 5: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_individuals
 * Version 6: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_families
 * Version 7: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_sources
 * Version 8: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_media/media_mapping
 * Version 9: Performance tuning: update column definitions for pgv_favorites/nextid/other/placelinks/places/remotelinks
 * Version 10: Move the $DEFAULT_GEDCOM setting from gedcoms.php to pgv_site_setting
 * Version 11: Add the modules and module_privacy tables for module administration
 * Version 12: Move $GEDCOMS from gedcoms.php to pgv_gedcom and pgv_gedcom_setting, split pgv_users into pgv_user/pgv_user_setting/pgv_user_gedcom_setting
 * Version 13: Move the hit-counters to a database table
 *
 * The script should assume that it can be interrupted at
 * any point, and be able to continue by re-running the script.
 * Fatal errors, however, should be allowed to throw exceptions,
 * which will be caught by the framework.
 * It shouldn't do anything that might take more than a few
 * seconds, for systems with low timeout values.
