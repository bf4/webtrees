Facts pertaining to the creation or modification of a family unit are entered on the Close Relatives/Family Link page. This is where you note marriages, divorces, children, family census - any fact or event that affects the family unit. We find when adding several children, it's best to bring up the VIEW FAMILY link for that husband/wife and add each child via the link at the bottom, 'ADD a CHILD to this Family'. It is faster than using the Close Relative page as with each addition it defaults back to the View INDI page rather than the Close Relative page. Any questions? Just ask if you don't understand.

The system allows you to browse your hard drive and upload the document with an entirely different name, retaining your local filename intact. Just imagine how many \"john.jpg\" files there could be (well - only one) but you could possibly overwrite an existing file if you don't change the filename. We like to keep them short (less than 35 characters) but descriptive - something like J_Name-b1820-I23445.jpg or K_Name-I23444-Headstn.jpg. If in doubt, please, simply ask us.";

Our site also uses the \"relationship privacy\" in PhpGedView. This feature allows you to view only the information of individuals defined as close relatives. If you are logged in and see certain individuals or families marked as \"Private\", then this site feature has been activated.

Your details can be removed from the site, however your access may also be restricted.
