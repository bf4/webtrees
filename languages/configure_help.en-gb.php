$pgv_lang["ABBREVIATE_CHART_LABELS_help"]="~#pgv_lang[ABBREVIATE_CHART_LABELS]#~<br /><br />This option controls whether or not to abbreviate labels like <b>Birth</b> on charts with just the first letter like <b>B</b>.<br /><br />You can customise the abbreviations by supplying overriding values in the <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> file for each language.  For example, if you want to use <b>*</b> instead of <b>N</b> to abbreviate the BIRT fact in the French language, you should put the following entry into the <i>languages/extra.fr.php</i> file:<br /><br /><code>\$factAbbrev[\"BIRT\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"*\";</code><br /><br />The lengths of abbreviations specified this way are not limited to 1 character.<br />";
$pgv_lang["ENABLE_AUTOCOMPLETE_help"]="~#pgv_lang[ENABLE_AUTOCOMPLETE]#~<br /><br />This option determines whether Autocomplete should be active while information is being entered into certain fields on input forms.  When this option is set to <b>#pgv_lang[yes]#</b>, text input fields for which Autocomplete is possible are indicated by a differently coloured background.<br /><br />When Autocomplete is active, PhpGedView will search its database for possible matches according to what you have already entered.  As you enter more information, the list of possible matches is refined.  When you see the desired input in the list of matches, you can move the mouse cursor to that line of the list and then click the left mouse button to complete the input.<br /><br />The disadvantages of Autocomplete are that it slows the program, entails significant database activity, and also results in more data being sent to the browser.<br />";
$pgv_lang["FAVICON"]="Favourites icon";
$pgv_lang["FAVICON_help"]="~#pgv_lang[FAVICON]#~<br /><br />Change this to point to the icon you want to display in peoples' favourites menu when they bookmark your site.<br />";
$pgv_lang["PEDIGREE_SHOW_GENDER"]="Show sex icon on charts";
$pgv_lang["PEDIGREE_SHOW_GENDER_help"]="~#pgv_lang[PEDIGREE_SHOW_GENDER]#~<br /><br />This option controls whether or not to show the individual's sex icon on charts.<br /><br />Since the sex is also indicated by the colour of the box, this option doesn't conceal the sex. The option simply removes some duplicate information from the box.<br />";
$pgv_lang["PGV_SMTP_SSL_help"]="~#pgv_lang[PGV_SMTP_SSL]#~<br /><br />Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) are Internet data encryption protocols.<br /><br />TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are standardised developments of SSL 3.0. TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.1 are equivalent. Further work on SSL is now done under the new name, TLS.<br /><br />If your SMTP Server requires the TLS or SSL protocol during login, you should select the <b>#pgv_lang[yes]#</b> option.<br />";
$pgv_lang["SHOW_PRIVATE_RELATIONSHIPS_help"]="~#pgv_lang[SHOW_PRIVATE_RELATIONSHIPS]#~<br /><br />This option will retain family links in privatised records.  This means that you will see empty \"private\" boxes on the pedigree chart and on other charts with private people.<br /><br />This is similar to the behaviour of PhpGedView versions prior to v4.0.<br /><br />This setting is off by default.  It is recommended instead of turning this on, to point your pedigree root person in your GEDCOM configuration to a person who is not private.<br />";
$pgv_lang["SHOW_SPIDER_TAGLINE_help"]	= "~#pgv_lang[SHOW_SPIDER_TAGLINE]#~<br /><br />On pages generated for search engines, display as the last line the particular search engine the page detected.  If this option is on, it can bias Google AdSense towards search engine optimisation tools.<br />";
$pgv_lang["SYNC_GEDCOM_FILE"]="Synchronise edits into GEDCOM file";
$pgv_lang["SYNC_GEDCOM_FILE_help"]="~#pgv_lang[SYNC_GEDCOM_FILE]#~<br /><br />In past versions of PGV the pending edits were stored in the GEDCOM file and the changed records were then \"accepted\" into the database.  Starting with v4.1 pending changes are no longer stored in the GEDCOM file but in the changes file.  <br /><br />Setting this value to true will update the GEDCOM file when changes are accepted into the database.  This will keep the GEDCOM file synchronised with the database.  For greater compatibility with previous versions the default value of this field is on.<br /><br />You may want to turn it off to conserve memory when accepting changes.<br />";
$pgv_lang["THEME_DIR_help"]="~#pgv_lang[THEME_DIR]#~<br /><br />The directory where your PhpGedView theme files are kept.<br /><br />You may customise any of the standard themes that come with PhpGedView to give your site a unique look and feel.  See the Theme Customization section of the <a href=\"readme.txt\">readme.txt</a> file for more information.<br />";
$pgv_lang["add_faq_pgvLangRefs"]="You can insert references to entries in the language files or to values of global variables.  Examples: <ul><li><b>&#x23;pgv_lang[add_to_cart]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the language variable \$pgv_lang[\"add_to_cart\"], and if it were to appear in this field, would show as <b>#pgv_lang[add_to_cart]#</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language.</li><li><b>&#x23;factarray[AFN]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the Fact name \$factarray[\"AFN\"], and if it were to appear in this field, would show as <b>#factarray[AFN]#</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language. </li><li><b>&#x23;GLOBALS[VERSION]&#x23;&nbsp;&#x23;GLOBALS[VERSION_RELEASE]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the global variable \$VERSION, a space, and a reference to the global variable \$VERSION_RELEASE, and if they were to appear in this field, would show as <b>#GLOBALS[VERSION]#&nbsp;#GLOBALS[VERSION_RELEASE]#</b> when the FAQ list is viewed in the current language.</li><li><b>&#x23;GLOBALS[GEDCOM]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the global variable \$GEDCOM, which is the name of the current GEDCOM file.  If it were to appear in this field, it would show as <b>#GLOBALS[GEDCOM]#</b>.</li><li><b>&#x23;GLOBALS[GEDCOM_TITLE]&#x23;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reference to the global variable \$GEDCOM_TITLE, which is the title of the current GEDCOM file.  If it were to appear in this field, it would show as <b>#GLOBALS[GEDCOM_TITLE]#</b>.</li></ul><br />This feature is useful when you wish to create FAQ lists that are different for each language your site supports.  You should put your customised FAQ list titles and entries into the <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> files (<i>xx</i> is the code for each language), using the following format:<br />\$pgv_lang[\"faq_title1\"] = \"This is a sample FAQ title\";<br />\$pgv_lang[\"faq_body1\"] = \"This is a sample FAQ body.\";<br />";
$pgv_lang["date_format_help2"]="<li><b>Calendar Conversion</b><br />The <b>R</b> code is somewhat unusual in its behaviour.  When this code appears in the date format, the normal date will be shown a second time, but in a different calendar system.  The elements of this alternate calendar date will obey the same rules as those of the main part of the format specification, except that the output of the <b>R</b> formatting code is enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from the regular date.  The examples given under <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar will make this a little clearer.<br /><br />The alternate calendar to be used for the <b>R</b> code is determined according to the current page language.  When the page language is Hebrew, the <b>Jewish</b> calendar will be used.  When the page language is Arabic, the <b>Hijri</b> calendar will be used.  For all other page languages, the <b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar is used.<br /><br />The action of this code is similar to the choice of calendar format that you can make on the GEDCOM Configuration page.  The difference between the two methods is that the <b>R</b> code, being defined at the Language Configuration level, works only on selected languages but across all GEDCOMs on the site.  The calendar option set at the GEDCOM Configuration level works on all languages but only on the GEDCOMs for which that option has been set.<br /><ul><li><b>French Revolutionary</b> calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calendar is also called <b>French Republican</b> calendar.<br /><br />Except for a very brief period in May 1871, this calendar system was only in use in France and only between 22&nbsp;SEP&nbsp;1792 and 31&nbsp;DEC&nbsp;1805.  Accordingly, the French Revolutionary calendar format will only be applicable when the date is within that range.<br /><br />Two example date formats, assuming the page language to be English, will illustrate the action of the <b>R</b> code:<br /><b>Y.m.d&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>1805.04.26&nbsp;(XIII.08.06)</b> or <b>1806.01.01</b>;&nbsp; <b>j&nbsp;F&nbsp;Y&nbsp;R</b> could produce <b>13&nbsp;October&nbsp;1797&nbsp;(22&nbsp;Vend√©miaire&nbsp;VI)</b> or <b>1&nbsp;January&nbsp;1806</b>.</li></ul><br /></li><li><b>Language alternatives</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abbreviated texts for the Advanced codes <b>D</b> and <b>M</b> are set in the file <i>languages/lang.xx.php</i>, using  statements like <code>\$pgv_lang[\"sunday_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Su\";</code>&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>\$pgv_lang[\"apr_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"April\";</code><br /><br />These can be changed by using a <i>languages/extra.xx.php</i> file as described in Wiki and ReadMe text for language adjustments, for example:<br /><code>\$pgv_lang[\"sunday_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Sun\";<br />\$pgv_lang[\"apr_1st\"]&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"Apr\";</code><br /><br /><br /></li><li><b>Localization</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special formatting rules exist for a number of languages, particularly declension of month endings according to how the date is phrased.  These special rules are implemented in the various <i>includes/extras/functions.xx.php</i> files.</li></ul>";
$pgv_lang["import_sql"]="SQL files have been found in your index directory. Since they may have originated from the User Migration tool, you have the option to import the information into your database. Do you wish to attempt importing these files into your database now? All existing user-related information (users, news, favourites, block layouts, and messages) in your database will be lost.<br /><br />If you choose to proceed, PhpGedView will attempt to import the data. If this is not successful, you will be asked to make the first administrator account anyway.<br />";
$pgv_lang["multi_letter_equiv_help"]="~#pgv_lang[multi_letter_equiv]#~<br /><br />In some languages, multiple letters are often treated as equivalent to a single letter when generating lists of names.<br /><br />For example, in Dutch, names beginning with IJ are listed together with names beginning with Y. In Norwegian, names beginning with AA are listed with &Aring;. In some languages, there are letters that can be written as one character or two. For example in Slovakian, the two characters D and \xC5\xBE can be written as the single character \xC7\x85. By specifying equivalents here, you can allow names beginning with these letters to be grouped together on the individual list pages.<br /><br />You should specify a comma-separated list of equivalents. To support databases that don't recognise UTF-8 encoding, you should specify both upper and lower case equivalents. This example demonstrates the format to use.<br /><br />Aa=&Aring;,aa=&aring;";

$pgv_lang["um_explain"]="This tool will either export user data from SQL to Index mode, or import user data from Index files into SQL tables.<br /><br />User data, favourites, block definitions, messages, and news will be available again after migration.<br /><br /><b>CAUTION</b><br />You cannot use this tool to migrate user data between different versions of PhpGedView. Be sure that the data originates from, or is imported into the same PhpGedView version.<br /><br /><b>IMPORT</b><br />If you choose to import the user data files from Index mode, all user data present in the database tables will be <u>overwritten</u>. This tool does <u>not</u> merge the information. Once you have run the Import, there is no way to retrieve the old information using PhpGedView.<br /><br /><b>EXPORT</b><br />If you export the user information from your SQL database to Index Mode files, this tool will create <i>authenticate.php</i> and several <i>.dat</i> files in your index directory. If identically named files are already present, you will be prompted if they must be overwritten.
