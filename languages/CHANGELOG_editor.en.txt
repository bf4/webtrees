# $Id$

For changes prior to 2005.03.15, please refer to LANG_CHANGELOG_bef.20050315.txt
For changes between 2005.03.15 and 2005.12.08, refer to LANG_CHANGELOG_bef.2005.12.08.txt
The LANG_CHANGELOG.txt file was getting too big to work with easily.

Use this file to follow the changes made to the English language files
between different versions of phpGedView.  There are seven separate CHANGELOG files,
one to correspond to each file that together make up the entire set of English text.

The CHANGELOG files are:
		CHANGELOG_configure_help.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_countries.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_facts.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_help_text.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_lang.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_admin.en.txt
		CHANGELOG_editor.en.txt
		
+ $pgv_lang["text"] / means added
- $pgv_lang["text"] / deleted
* $pgv_lang["text"] / text was changed

Additional codes, to help Translators, follow the date as follows:
	A - Added or moved from another file
	C - Capitalization  (doesn't affect translation)
	D - Deleted
	f - Minor format change
	F - Major format change
	p - Punctuation change  (doesn't affect translation)
	M - Moved to another file
	S - Spelling change		(doesn't affect translation)
	w - Minor wording change
	W - Major wording change or completely new text

The above list of codes may be amended as new situations arise.
For massive changes, the variable names should be listed in the order in which they
occur in the respective language files.
